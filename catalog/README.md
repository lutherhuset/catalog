---PROJECT DESCRIPTION---
The GR8EST app is a catalog app that stores information for the legends of different sports.
This project utilizes CRUD operations, Google Oauth, and flask.
Some starter code from Udacity was utilized in the early stages of this project.

---DEPENDENCIES/SETUP---
To open this project you will need to download all the files from github at https://github.com/lutherhuset/catalog/
Either by manually downloading or by using a fork or clone via git.

Then you will need to make sure you have access to flask and sqlalchemy modules.
You can utilize pip to install those modules for you.

The process of getting this app to work requires you to run the datbase_setup.py file first, followed by the legendinfo.py file which fills the database with some beginning information.
Then you can run the main file for this app which is gr8est.py.

You can run those in a gitbash terminal by typing python and then the name of the file you wish to download.

Once you run the gr8est.py file the site should be running locally on port 8000.

---USAGE---
Once you get to the site you can view the public information.
To make edits to the activities and legends you will need to sign in via Google Oauth.

You will then be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete legends and activities.
You can enter new legends into the systems providing information on their stats, position, and salary.

---ISSUES/FUTURE PLANS---
I will continue to improve the visual appeal of this application and hopefully include photos of the legends next to their name.

---CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES---
This app is publicly open to vview and work with. Any additional functionality or visual improvements are welcome.
My own API key is utilized in this code, which has limitations. Use your own API key for increased traffic.
